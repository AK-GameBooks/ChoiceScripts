This is the last scene!  The game is over!

*page_break
This is the last page of the game, where we ask people to share the game with their friends.

Think carefully about where to use the "share_this_game" command, because it includes the 
"Rate this app" link.  Prefer to use it on the "Congratulations!" screen, but not the
"Game Over, you lose" screen.

Please support our work by sharing this game with friends!  The more people play, the more
resources we'll have to work on the next game.
